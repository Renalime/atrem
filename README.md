# ATREM (Another Tiny Regular Expression Matcher)

## What is it all about?
This project was started for the sake of practicing in the C programming language. As a starting point I chose [this](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html) article by Brian Kernighan, but except that, there are lots of other resources that will be used and, of cource, cited here. This is supposed to be a library when it's released (actually, sounds like a joke to me, considering current state of the project).

So, for now, it's not an open source project, since it lacks a lot of needed pieces.  If the project will be big enough in terms of functionality and I will deem this project as something valuable to the open source community, then it's possible for the project to become a part of the open source world.  

## Current state
Right now there is nothing in the repository, but in the near future, i believe, there will be a lot of beatiful code (well, we all know that this is not going to happen).

## Plans
I plan to include a basic functionality in the library, although i haven't defined what a basic functionality is. So, for the current state of affairs, let this be as it is (I hope that I won't forget to add some details to this section).
